    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I've spent my whole two-year career working in software development, and thanks to my dedication to critical thinking and attention to detail, I am now a senior software engineer in Mainframe Technology. I'm a skilled team leader who normally oversees 4 engineers at once, and I'm passionate about processes.

        Prior to taking on my current position, I worked at Mainframe First as a software engineer and programmer. I've already had every other position in this industry, so I have a thorough understanding of what it takes to manage a project successfully. As a CTO, I want to transition into a database administration position since I know it will help me develop my leadership abilities</p>

    <h2>My Favorite Food</h2>
    <p>My all-time favorite food is Indian cuisine. I love it because of its rich and diverse flavors, the use of aromatic spices, and the wide variety of dishes it offers. Whether it's the creamy goodness of butter chicken, the fiery heat of a good vindaloo, or the comfort of a flavorful biryani, Indian food never fails to tantalize my taste buds. The combination of spices and ingredients in each dish is a culinary masterpiece that I can't get enough of.</p>
